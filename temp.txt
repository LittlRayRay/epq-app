Step 1 Remove the sticker TOOL USED ON THIS STEP: Precision Tweezers £4.99 Buy Use blunt tweezers to peel off the sticker covering the right-side screw on the back of the console. Before starting this guide: Turn off the device. Then, unplug any cables from the console. Add a comment
Step 2 Remove the external screws Use a T10 Torx screwdriver to remove the two 12.6 mm–long screws located on the back of the console. Add a comment
Step 3 Slide the upper case horizontally Rotate the console 90 degrees. Pull the front of the upper plastic case horizontally toward the front of the console until it comes to a stop. This slides the clips out of the slots on the upper plastic case. Add a comment
Step 4 Lift the upper case off the lower case Rotate the console 90 degrees so that the back is facing you. Lift up the left side of the upper plastic case (as viewed from the back of the console), stopping when it won’t lift any further. Add a comment
Step 5 While continuing to hold the left side of the upper plastic case, push up on the right side to move the right-side screw boss out of the way. If pushing up on the case doesn't work, try moving it in different directions until it can swing open. Swing the upper plastic case open to 75 degrees. Add a comment
Step 6 Push the upper plastic case down and away from the console to remove it completely. One comment
Step 7 Disconnect the ribbon cable Use the pointed end of a spudger, an opening tool, or your fingernail to flip down the small, hinged locking flap on the ribbon cable ZIF connector on the front circuit board. One comment
Step 8 Disconnect the ribbon cable TOOL USED ON THIS STEP: Precision Tweezers £4.99 Buy Use blunt tweezers to pull the ribbon cable down out of the connector. 3 comments
Step 9 Remove the front circuit board screws Use a T8 Torx screwdriver to remove the three 13.3 mm screws securing the front circuit board to the upper metal case. One comment
Step 10 Remove the front circuit board Pull the front circuit board straight out away from the upper metal case and set it aside. Grip the board on either side of where it is plugged in to avoid bending and damaging it. One comment
Step 11 Remove the upper metal case screws Use a T10 Torx screwdriver to remove the six 47.7 mm screws securing the upper metal case to the lower plastic case. Use a T8 Torx screwdriver to remove the two 7.5 mm screws securing the press connector to the upper metal case. 3 comments
Step 12 Detach the press connector Insert the flat end of a spudger underneath the press connector on the side opposite of the ribbon cable. Use the spudger to lift the press connector up and away from the upper metal case. Don't push the spudger all the way to the socket. Prying up the socket may damage it. To re-attach press connectors like this one, carefully align and press down on one side until it clicks into place, then repeat on the other side. Do not press down on the middle. If the connector is misaligned, the pins can bend, causing permanent damage. One comment
Step 13 Remove the lower plastic case Flip the console over. Hold on to the lower plastic case because it is no longer attached to the metal case. Lift the lower plastic case up from the metal case and set it aside. 2 comments

Step 16 Unscrew the power supply Flip the console over. The disc drive is only attached to the motherboard by two cable connectors. Hold the disc drive when flipping the console over to avoid damaging it. Use a T10 Torx screwdriver to remove the two 11.4 mm screws securing the power supply to the upper metal case Add a comment
Step 17 Loosen the disc drive Lift the disc drive so that its metal tab is unhooked from the power supply. The disc drive is plugged into the motherboard. Don’t bend the wires more than necessary to avoid damaging them. Place the disc drive on the upper metal case so that it sits over the hard drive. You'll need enough space to unplug the power supply from the motherboard. Add a comment
Step 18 Unstick the foam tape on the power supply Insert the flat end of the spudger underneath the dark grey foam tape starting at the corner closest to the power supply and edge of the console. Lift up the corner. Slowly push the spudger through to the other side of the tape until you can see the flat end emerge. Remove the spudger slowly. There are two grey cables underneath the foam tape. Try to avoid hitting them with the spudger so that you don't damage them. Add a comment
Step 19 Unplug the power supply Lift the power supply directly upward to unplug it from the motherboard. Move the disc drive further away from the power supply if you need more space. 2 comments
Step 20 Set the power supply to the side After the power supply is unplugged from the motherboard, rotate and lift it away from the console. The two grey cables are still attached to the console by the dark grey foam tape and the power supply socket beneath the fan case. Avoid bending the cables more than necessary to prevent damage. Place the power supply so that it is sitting on its side just outside the upper metal case. Add a comment
